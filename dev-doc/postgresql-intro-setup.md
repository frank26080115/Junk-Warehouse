Got it üëç You want something like **phpMyAdmin for PostgreSQL**, on **Windows** for learning, with the ability to move to **Ubuntu VPS** later. Let‚Äôs go step by step:

---

## 1. Install PostgreSQL on Windows

The easiest way is to use the **official installer (EDB)**:

* Download: [PostgreSQL Windows Installer](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/)
* During setup, check the box to install:

  * **PostgreSQL Server**
  * **pgAdmin 4** (GUI)
  * **Command Line Tools**

This gives you both the server and a web-based GUI (pgAdmin) locally.
pgAdmin is the ‚ÄúphpMyAdmin equivalent‚Äù for PostgreSQL.

---

## 2. pgAdmin GUI (phpMyAdmin-like)

* Once installed, launch **pgAdmin 4** from Start Menu.
* It runs in your browser, connected to the local PostgreSQL server.
* Default superuser = `postgres` (set the password during install).
* You can create databases, tables, run SQL queries, etc.
  The interface is very similar to phpMyAdmin.

---

## 3. Minimal Setup Alternative (if you want lighter than pgAdmin)

If you find pgAdmin too heavy, alternatives include:

* **Adminer** ‚Äì single PHP file, works with PostgreSQL, similar to phpMyAdmin.

  * Needs PHP installed.
* **HeidiSQL** ‚Äì lightweight Windows app, supports PostgreSQL (and MySQL, MSSQL).
* **DBeaver CE** ‚Äì cross-platform, works with PostgreSQL, nice GUI.

üëâ If you want something closest to phpMyAdmin in simplicity, **Adminer** is the best.

---

## 4. Easy Transfer to Ubuntu VPS

On your VPS you‚Äôll want:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

GUI options on VPS:

* **pgAdmin 4** (can run server-side as a web app, like phpMyAdmin).
* **Adminer** (simplest if you already have Nginx/Apache and PHP).
* **DBeaver** (just keep it on your Windows PC and connect remotely).

---

## 5. Suggested Workflow for You

* **On Windows (learning):**

  1. Install PostgreSQL + pgAdmin via the official installer.
  2. If pgAdmin feels heavy, try HeidiSQL or DBeaver.

* **On Ubuntu VPS (deployment):**

  1. Install PostgreSQL (`apt install postgresql`).
  2. For GUI: run **pgAdmin 4** in server mode or just connect remotely with DBeaver from your Windows PC.
  3. If you want a browser-based phpMyAdmin-style tool, deploy **Adminer**.

---

‚ö° Recommendation for *fastest path to learning*:
Just install PostgreSQL + pgAdmin on Windows ‚Üí learn SQL basics there.
Later, on Ubuntu VPS, install PostgreSQL server only, and connect to it from your Windows pgAdmin/DBeaver instead of installing a GUI on the VPS.

---

You don‚Äôt need to worry about Stack Builder right now üôÇ

Stack Builder is basically a **package manager for add-ons**. It offers things like:

* **PostGIS** ‚Üí spatial database support (for mapping/GIS work)
* **pgAgent** ‚Üí job scheduling (like cron for PostgreSQL)
* **ODBC/JDBC drivers** ‚Üí for connecting PostgreSQL to other apps
* **Npgsql** ‚Üí .NET data provider
* and other extensions/tools

For **learning PostgreSQL basics** you can safely skip all of these.

üëâ Just finish the install with the database server + pgAdmin. Later, if you discover you need something (like PostGIS for GIS projects), you can always reopen Stack Builder and add it.

---

You don‚Äôt copy raw database files around (they‚Äôre not portable across OS/versions and PostgreSQL won‚Äôt recognize them if you drop them in). Instead, PostgreSQL has **export/import tools**:

---

## ‚úÖ The Proper Way: `pg_dump` and `psql`

PostgreSQL databases are usually moved with a **dump file** (text-based SQL script).

**On your home PC (Windows):**

```powershell
pg_dump -U postgres -d mydb -f mydb_dump.sql
```

* `-U postgres` ‚Üí user (you set during install)
* `-d mydb` ‚Üí your database name
* `-f mydb_dump.sql` ‚Üí output file

This creates a file full of `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT`, etc.

**Transfer the file to your VPS**
Since the VPS can‚Äôt connect to your PC, you just do the opposite:

* Save the dump file locally
* Upload it to the VPS with:

  ```bash
  scp mydb_dump.sql username@your-vps-ip:/home/username/
  ```

  (or just drag-drop with something like WinSCP)

**On the VPS (Ubuntu):**

```bash
psql -U postgres -d mydb -f mydb_dump.sql
```

That rebuilds the database.

---

## ‚úÖ Alternative: `pg_dump` with custom format

You can also export to a binary dump (smaller, faster to restore):

```powershell
pg_dump -U postgres -Fc -d mydb -f mydb.dump
```

Then on VPS:

```bash
pg_restore -U postgres -d mydb mydb.dump
```

---

## üö´ What *not* to do

* Don‚Äôt try to copy `/var/lib/postgresql/...` files between systems ‚Äî those are tied to the exact PostgreSQL version, platform, and configuration.
* Don‚Äôt worry if the VPS can‚Äôt connect back to your home PC ‚Äî `pg_dump` + file transfer is the normal method.

---

‚ö° So the workflow is:

1. `pg_dump` ‚Üí make SQL or binary dump on your PC
2. Upload file to VPS
3. `psql` or `pg_restore` ‚Üí import into VPS database

# Dumping just the table schema

`export PGPASSWORD=YOUR_PASSWORD`

`pg_dump -s -U junkwarehouse -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -d junkwarehouse_db -N information_schema -N pg_catalog --no-owner --no-privileges -f schema.sql`

NOTE: `junkwarehouse` is a user within the database, `PGPASSWORD` is the password for `junkwarehouse`, `junkwarehouse_db` is the database name, `schema.sql` is the output file path

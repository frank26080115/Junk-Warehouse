this project involves a node.js + react + bootstrap frontend and a flask backend with postgresql as the database

I will have a page that edits an item represented by a row of data in the database, I want it to save automatically on every keystroke, but also not actually have a billion UPDATE calls

How can I simply have the backend save the latest JSON being sent from the frontend, which also resets a timer, and a thread say "it's been 10 seconds since last keystroke, execute the DB UPDATE call"?

---

You can do this with a tiny **server-side debounce buffer**: every keystroke `PUT`s the latest JSON to a Flask endpoint that just caches it in memory and **resets a 10s timer**. When the timer fires (no keystrokes for 10s), it does the **actual DB UPDATE** once.

Below is a minimal, drop-in implementation.

> Swap the `flush_to_db` body with your `update_db_row_by_dict(engine, "items", item_id, payload, fuzzy=True)` if you want column-aware updates.

# Frontend sketch (React)

* Keep a local component state as usual.
* On each input change, `fetch('/api/items/:id/buffer', { method:'POST', body: JSON.stringify(item) })`.
* (Optional) Also **client-side debounce** to \~200‚Äì300ms so you‚Äôre not hammering the network.

```ts
let inFlight: number | undefined;

function sendBuffer(id: string, data: any) {
  window.clearTimeout(inFlight);
  inFlight = window.setTimeout(() => {
    fetch(`/api/items/${id}/buffer`, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify(data),
    });
  }, 250); // client-side debounce for fewer POSTs
}
```

# Important notes

* **In-process only**: This debounce lives in the **Flask process memory**. That‚Äôs perfect for dev and a single-process deployment.

  * If you run **multiple workers** (e.g., Gunicorn with 4 workers), each worker has its own buffer. For production, use a **shared store** (e.g., Redis) and a **single background worker** or a distributed debounce key (Redis key per item with TTL and a stream/queue to flush).
* **Crash safety**: If the server crashes within the debounce window, you can lose unsaved keystrokes. If that matters, also write the ‚Äúbuffer‚Äù to a **drafts** table on each hit, and promote to the main table on flush.
* **Id scoping**: If multiple users could edit the same item (even in your DIY setup), consider scoping keys as `f"{user_id}:{item_id}"` to avoid cross-interference.
* **HTTP codes**: `202 Accepted` is a nice hint that the write is queued; use `200` if you prefer.

This gives you: **instant keystroke saves** that are cheap (cache only) and a **single DB UPDATE** after 10s of inactivity.

---

I am not understanding the lifetime of this "saver" object that looks like a local variable

---

Great you‚Äôre asking this üëç ‚Äî because this is one of those subtle Flask ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs global vs what‚Äôs per-request‚Äù things.

Let‚Äôs walk through what‚Äôs happening in that example:

---

## 1. Where the `saver` lives

```python
def create_app():
    app = Flask(__name__)
    engine = get_engine()

    def flush_to_db(item_id, payload): ...
    saver = DebouncedSaver(delay_seconds=10, flush_func=flush_to_db)

    @app.post("/api/items/<item_id>/buffer")
    def buffer_item(item_id):
        saver.update(item_id, request.get_json())
        return jsonify(ok=True)

    return app
```

* The `saver = DebouncedSaver(...)` line runs **once**, when `create_app()` is called.
* That `saver` is **captured in the closure** of each route function (`buffer_item`, `flush_item`‚Ä¶), so it‚Äôs *not* re-created per request.
* Effectively, it‚Äôs a **singleton object** that lives for the whole lifetime of that Flask app instance.

So when multiple requests come in, they‚Äôre all talking to the **same `saver` object in memory**.

---

## 2. The lifetime of the Flask app itself

* When you run `flask run` or `python -m flask ‚Ä¶`, Flask creates *one* `app` object (by calling your `create_app()`).
* That `app` object ‚Äî and anything it holds (like `saver`) ‚Äî lives until the process exits.
* Every HTTP request is handled by calling into that same `app`.

---

## 3. Thread/process considerations

* In the **Werkzeug dev server** (the thing `flask run` launches by default), you have **one process** with possibly multiple threads.
  All threads share the same Python memory, so they share your one `saver`.
* In **production** with something like Gunicorn + multiple workers, each worker process has its **own copy of the `saver`**, because each process calls `create_app()`.

  * That means edits routed to worker A wouldn‚Äôt be visible in worker B‚Äôs `saver`.
  * For production safety, you‚Äôd replace the in-memory `saver` with a shared backend (Redis, Postgres ‚Äúdrafts‚Äù table, etc.).

---

## 4. What you saw in my code

Even though `saver` looks like a **local variable**, it‚Äôs closed over by the route functions, so Flask keeps a reference to it forever.
That makes it effectively a **module-global singleton** for as long as the app is running.

---

‚úÖ **Rule of thumb**:

* Stuff you want **per request** ‚Üí use `request` or `flask.g`.
* Stuff you want **for the whole app lifetime** ‚Üí create once in `create_app()` and close over it or attach to `app` (e.g., `app.saver = DebouncedSaver(...)`).

---

Would you like me to rewrite that snippet so `saver` is **explicitly attached to `app`**, so you can see it‚Äôs not just a ‚Äúhidden local,‚Äù but a real singleton hanging off the app object?

---

Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs attach it to the **Flask app object** so it‚Äôs obvious the `saver` is part of the application‚Äôs lifetime, not a throwaway local.

---

### Revised backend snippet

```python
# backend/app/main.py
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from sqlalchemy import text
import logging
from apps.db import get_engine
from services.debounced_save import DebouncedSaver

log = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def create_app():
    app = Flask(__name__)
    engine = get_engine()

    # Define how to actually write to DB when the debounce window expires
    def flush_to_db(item_id: str, payload: dict):
        cols = ", ".join([f"{k} = :{k}" for k in payload.keys()])
        stmt = text(f"UPDATE items SET {cols} WHERE id = :_id")
        params = {**payload, "_id": item_id}
        with engine.begin() as conn:
            conn.execute(stmt, params)
        log.info("DB update executed for item %s", item_id)

    # Attach a single DebouncedSaver instance to the app object
    app.saver = DebouncedSaver(delay_seconds=10.0, flush_func=flush_to_db)

    # Route uses the app-level saver
    @app.post("/api/items/<item_id>/buffer")
    def buffer_item(item_id: str):
        data = request.get_json(silent=True)
        if not isinstance(data, dict):
            return jsonify(ok=False, error="JSON object required"), 400
        app.saver.update(item_id, data)
        return jsonify(ok=True), 202

    @app.post("/api/items/<item_id>/flush")
    def flush_item(item_id: str):
        ok = app.saver.flush_now(item_id)
        return jsonify(ok=ok), (200 if ok else 204)

    @app.teardown_appcontext
    def _shutdown(_exc):
        # clean up timers when the app context shuts down
        app.saver.shutdown()

    return app

app = create_app()
```

---

### What this means

* There is **exactly one `DebouncedSaver` per Flask app instance**.
* Any route, blueprint, or background task can access it as `current_app.saver`:

```python
from flask import current_app

def do_something():
    current_app.saver.update("item123", {"field": "value"})
```

* This makes its lifetime **the same as the app‚Äôs lifetime** ‚Äî it‚Äôs created once when `create_app()` runs and torn down when the process exits (or app is destroyed in tests).

---

‚ö†Ô∏è Reminder:
This is fine for **dev / single-worker mode**. If you run Gunicorn with multiple workers, each worker process will have its own `.saver`. To make it truly global across workers, you‚Äôd move the buffer into Redis/Postgres/etc.

---

üëâ Do you want me to also show you how to make a **drafts table** in Postgres so you don‚Äôt lose keystrokes if the Flask process crashes, while still only updating the ‚Äúreal‚Äù row after the debounce expires?

Got it ✅ — since you don’t care about minification or fancy bundling, you can keep things super simple and still be “proper.”

## 🎨 Standard places in a frontend repo

In the `frontend/` directory you’d have:

```
frontend/
├─ src/
│  ├─ main.tsx        # or main.js
│  ├─ App.tsx
│  ├─ components/
│  ├─ styles/         # CSS you import
│  │  ├─ global.css
│  │  └─ button.css
│  └─ assets/         # images/fonts/icons you import
│     ├─ logo.png
│     ├─ background.jpg
│     └─ icons/
│
└─ public/            # static files served as-is, no processing
   ├─ favicon.ico
   ├─ robots.txt
   └─ splash.png
```

### 🔑 Rule of thumb

* **`src/assets/`**

  * Images/CSS/JSON/etc. that you `import` in React/Vue/TS.
  * Example:

    ```tsx
    import logo from './assets/logo.png';
    import './styles/global.css';
    ```
  * These go through whatever build step exists (even if you don’t care about minification, Vite/Webpack will handle resolving paths).

* **`public/`**

  * Files that should be served **exactly as-is** at a fixed URL.
  * Example:

    * `public/favicon.ico` → available at `http://localhost:5173/favicon.ico`
    * `public/images/foo.png` → available at `/images/foo.png`
  * Good for large assets you don’t want copied/renamed by the build process.

* **CSS**

  * If you’re not bundling or using CSS-in-JS, just put them under `src/styles/` and `import` them in your entrypoint (e.g. `main.tsx`).
  * If you want truly global, static CSS, you can drop it into `public/` and `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/global.css">` in `index.html`.

### 🚦 If you want zero build fuss

You could even skip `src/` entirely and just serve straight from `public/` with plain HTML + CSS + JS. But if you are already using React or TypeScript, `src/` + `public/` is the standard split.

👉 Do you want me to give you a **minimal “no-minify React + CSS + images” frontend skeleton** that would just run under Vite but without any bundling complexity?

Perfect timing — this is exactly the kind of thing **npm is designed to solve** 🎯

## 🔹 How npm tracks installs

When you run:

```bash
npm install bootstrap
```

two important things happen:

1. A copy of Bootstrap (and its dependencies) is downloaded into `node_modules/`.
   👉 This folder is **not** meant to be committed to git.

2. Your `package.json` is updated (if you used `--save` or `--save-dev`).

   * `"dependencies": { "bootstrap": "^5.3.3" }` gets added.

3. A `package-lock.json` file is updated/created.

   * This pins *exact versions* of Bootstrap and all its nested dependencies (so you get the same versions later).

---

## 🔹 How you “redo” installs on another machine

When you (or a teammate, or a fresh VPS) checks out the repo, you just run:

```bash
npm install
```

npm will:

* Read `package.json` → know you need `"bootstrap": "^5.3.3"`.
* Read `package-lock.json` → fetch the exact versions you had.
* Repopulate `node_modules/` with the same stuff.

---

## 🔹 Workflow summary

1. In your repo:

   ```bash
   npm install bootstrap
   ```
2. Commit:

   * ✅ `package.json`
   * ✅ `package-lock.json`
   * ❌ **do not** commit `node_modules/` (add it to `.gitignore`).
3. On another machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repo>
   cd <repo>
   npm install
   ```

Now Bootstrap (and any other dependencies) are restored exactly as before.

## 🔹 Quick pro-tips

* Use `npm install <pkg> --save-dev` for build tools (webpack, sass compilers, etc.).
* For global tools (like `npm install -g serve`), you’ll want to document those separately — they aren’t tracked in `package.json`.
* If you want **super exact reproducibility**, don’t delete `package-lock.json`.

---

✅ **Bottom line:** You don’t need to manually track every file. Just commit `package.json` and `package-lock.json`. Running `npm install` anywhere else will reproduce the same setup.

---

In modern npm (v5+), `npm install` **already saves dependencies** to your `package.json` by default, so you don’t actually need `--save` anymore. But if you want to be explicit (or you’re following older docs), here’s how:

```bash
npm install bootstrap --save
```

That will:

* Download Bootstrap into `node_modules/`
* Add an entry under `"dependencies"` in your `package.json`

Example after install:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "bootstrap": "^5.3.3"
}
```

---

### 🔹 For dev-only dependencies

If you’re installing something like a bundler or linter that you don’t need in production, use:

```bash
npm install webpack --save-dev
```

That goes under `"devDependencies"` in `package.json`.

---

✅ **Summary:**

* Normal dependency → `npm install <pkg> --save` (or just `npm install <pkg>`)
* Dev dependency → `npm install <pkg> --save-dev`

Want me to also show you how to make a **brand-new `package.json`** from scratch (with `npm init -y`) and then add Bootstrap so you can see the files created?
